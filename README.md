# METADATA CONTROLLER

Simple tool developed in C# to see Images and PDF documents metadata and erase it in case you don't want it.

### Dependencies needed

* [iTextSharp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/?source=typ_redirect)

**Still in development**

While I finish you can compile and execute the application by opening ```PruebaMetadatos.sln``` with Visual Studio.
