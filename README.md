# METADATA CONTROLLER

Simple tool developed in C# to see Images and PDF documents metadata and erase it in case you don't want it.

### Dependencies needed

* [iTextSharp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/?source=typ_redirect)

**Still in development**

While I finish you can compile and execute the application by opening ```PruebaMetadatos.sln``` with Visual Studio.
Or you can download the installer of my last build [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27944902/MetadataController.zip) but I don't know if it will work with you (I'm just a noob with Visual Studio :P)
